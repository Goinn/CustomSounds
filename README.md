## Setup
!After an update you might have to either grab the newest release of CustomSounds or reinstall MelonLoader completely!

0. Backup your game files
1. Prepare Synth Riders for the use with mods by following the installation instructions for MelonLoader:  https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation
2. Grab the newest version of CustomSounds from releases and add it under ./SynthRiders/Mods (create new directory if not existent)
3. Create a new directory for custom sounds under in the main game dircectory called CustomSounds
4. Extract the sound files from soundssamples.zip into the new directory
5. Customise sounds by overwriting the sample sounds files 
&. Profit?!

## Disclaimer
Adding this mod might cause random lag spikes during the song. 
Still investigating this as I had a live stream on last time I tested the mod and 
at least in theory the mod should only execute code immediately after a scene gets loaded.

This mod is not related to Synth Riders or Kluge Interactive in any way.
