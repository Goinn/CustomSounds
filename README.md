## Setup
!After an update you might have to either grab the newest release of CustomSounds or reinstall MelonLoader completely!

0. Backup your game files
1. Prepare Synth Riders for the use with mods by following the installation instructions for MelonLoader:  https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation
2. Grab the newest version of CustomSounds from releases and add it under ./SynthRiders/Mods (create new directory if not existent)
3. Extract the sound files from sfx.zip into the game directory
4. Customize sounds by overwriting the sample sounds files under CustomSounds (all provided files are empty sound files)
5. Profit?!

## Disclaimer
Adding this mod might cause random lag spikes during the song. 
Still investigating this as I had a live stream on last time I tested the mod and 
at least in theory the mod should only execute code immediately after a scene gets loaded.

This mod is not related to Synth Riders Devs or Kluge Interactive in any way.
