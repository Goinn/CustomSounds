## Setup
!After an update you might have to either grab the newest release of CustomSounds or reinstall MelonLoader completely!

0. Backup your game files
1. Prepare Synth Riders for the use with mods by following the installation instructions for MelonLoader:  https://wiki.synthriderz.com/en/guides/installing-mods
2. Grab the newest version of CustomSounds from releases and add it under ./SynthRiders/Mods (create new directory if not existent)
3. Extract the sound files from sfx.zip into the game directory
4. Customize sounds by overwriting the sample sounds files under CustomSounds
   All provided files are empty sound files and will mute existing sounds. If you want to keep the standard sound, delete the respective sound file!
5. Profit?!
